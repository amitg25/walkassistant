Prerequisite 
To accomplish this task we utilized the triangle similarity, which requires us to know two important parameters prior to applying our algorithm:
	.	The width (or height) in some distance measure, such as inches or meters, of the object we are using as a marker.
	.	The distance (in inches or meters) of the camera to the marker in step 1.
